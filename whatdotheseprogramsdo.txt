Q1: Scopes / Closures

a. This program declares and sets a value 1 for the variable x. After that it defines a function that changes the value of x to 2 and also returns a new function.
This new function in turn will show in the console the value of x when called.

After declaring the variable x and the function foo, it calls both foo and also the returning function and ends with a console log of x again.
What this will do is return 2 two times in the console, in different lines.

b. This program declares at the function scope a variable item, an array called result and also a function that declares i also at the function scope. 
The loop iterates tree times and pushes a function into the result array, but since i is declared at the function scope with var, i is capture with the final value of the loop for all cases.
This is made evident when you map over the values inside result. Since it will have a function with () => items[i] where i = 3 so it will return undefined since the max index is two in the items array.
The console returns [undefined, undefined, undefined]

c. Changing var i to let i changes the behavior completely as now i is defined in a block level. What this means is that each i is independent every iteration of the loop, so the results array gets pushed a function with () => items[0] and so on for 1 and 2.
This results in the intended behavior of getting in the console the result [1, 2, 3]

d. This code fixes the behavior of the code we saw in the point b. Instead of using let what it does is that it sets up an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) so that the value of i is capture at the moment of the loop iteration. This pushes to result the correct or intended value.
When you do console log you will get the intended result of [1, 2, 3]

Q2: Async programming

a. With that code as a base and then running 

resolveAfter2Seconds();
resolveAfter1Second();
console.log(`done!`);

What happens is that the first function starts with a console log that sends "starting slow promise" and then starts a promise that will resolve in 2 seconds.
Then the second function is executed which sends to the console "starting fast promise" and then starts a new promise that will resolve in 1 second.
After that the console log command is executed Immediately without waiting for the promises so the console gets "done!". After that the fast promise resolves and then the slow promise resolves.
So for the output you get:

starting slow promise
starting fast promise
done!
fast promise is done
slow promise is done

b. This one changes the execution order of fast and slow promises which changes the beginning of the output but not the end as the resolve time for the promises remains the same.
The new output would be:

starting fast promise
starting slow promise
done!
fast promise is done
slow promise is done

c. With adding the await command the execution of the program will now wait until the resolverAfter2Seconds() function resolves before continuing. Typically you would use await inside an async function.
With the added wait time the output now becomes:
starting slow promise
slow promise is done
starting fast promise
done!
fast promise is done

Q3: Error handling with async/await

a. So for this one it was interesting because I kept getting errors until I wrapped the instructions since starting in an async function and then called the function in the end.
By doing this the program starts as intended. What it does is that it creates a promise that will be ultimately rejected, this mean changing its state from pending to rejected or failed. This rejection gets handled with a try catch block that sends a console message once the error is caught.
The output of doing this process becomes the following:
== starting ==
starting slow promise
starting fast promise
it broke! fast
it broke! slow
== done ==

b. This case is very similar to the one before. I also had to wrap it inside an async function. The difference in this code is that the await for both functions is inside the same try catch block. Since the code waits for fast promise to finish it throws the error and the catch block gets executed. Once this happens the code continues with what's written after the catch block.
The error for the slow promise is then uncaught because the code execution has passed the try catch block.
The output is as follows:
== starting ==
starting slow promise
starting fast promise
it broke! fast
== done ==

You will also get a message about the uncaught error of the slow promise.

c. For this one I used Promised.all, this allowed me to have both promises executed at the same time and both would be handled by the same catch block after being settled.
